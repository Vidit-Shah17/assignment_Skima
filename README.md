# assignment_Skima

The assignement was:
You are required to build a backend service that accepts URLs and generates screenshots
of those pages. This service should work asynchronously â€” the screenshot operation must
not block the initial request. Once the screenshot is ready, the system must notify the
requester via a webhook.
This project is designed to test your understanding of background processing, API design,
asynchronous workflows, and working with external services.
